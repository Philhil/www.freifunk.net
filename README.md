rss-in-page

Plugin from http://www.titusbicknell.com/wordpress/rss-in-page extended to display a podlove web player per podcast episode. We'll use it with our podcast page and our podcast feed

time.ly-calendar-importer

Plugin written from scratch to import calendar feeds into time.ly calendars. We directly insert calendar entries into the database tables as there's no api to do it.
Features:
